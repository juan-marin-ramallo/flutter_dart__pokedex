# flutter_dart__pokedex
Pokedex application using Flutter with Dart

I recommend Flutter for building hybrid mobile apps using concepts similar to React.
For this one-day app, I worked with Firebase to manage cloud authentication and the following packages:
* dio, http: to connect with api "pokeapi.co"
* flutter_offline: enable offline capability to our apps and store offline needed data using SharedPreferences.
* provider, state_notifier, flutter_state_notifier y flutter_hooks: to manage and handle the widget states and notify to the app when widgets are updated.
* flutter_launcher_icons: this package allow generate the launcher icons version for our app.
* rxdart: It allows combine stream when you work with BloC pattern in Flutter
